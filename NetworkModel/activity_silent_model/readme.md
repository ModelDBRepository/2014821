**Read-me file for the activity-silent network model.
To generate panels A (top), C and D in Supplementary Figure 8.**


This folder contains:

- The python code to generate a single trial for a young/control activity-silent network. The python code uses the Brian2 simulator to simulate the networks.

- Data:
  - The folder `young_silent_network_singleTrial` contains the data files for a single trial (to generate panels A (top) and C).
  - The folder `young_silent_network_280trials` contains the data files for the 280 trials (to generate panel D).

- The matlab file `SilentNetwork.m` that generates panels A (top), C and D in Supplementary Figure 8. Files `circ_mean.m` and `circ_dist.m` calculate the circular mean and circular distance used in `SilentNetwork.m`.
